    "### **MICROSOFT WINDOWS FILES PATH LENGTHS SCREENER**\n",
    "---\n",
    "By utilizing this script, users can streamline their file management processes and avoid \n",
    "the complications associated with long file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to identify and report folders containing files with paths \n",
    "that exceed the maximum allowable length for Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **PURPOSE**\n",
    "In many cases, long file paths can lead to issues when trying to access, modify, or \n",
    "delete files, resulting in errors that can hinder productivity and workflow. This script \n",
    "helps users quickly locate these problematic folders, enabling them to manage their \n",
    "file organization more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **FEATURES**\n",
    "Path Length Check: The script traverses a specified directory and examines \n",
    "all files within its subfolders. If a file's path exceeds beyond a set up threshold of characters, \n",
    "the script records the folder containing that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique Folder Reporting: It aggregates the results to ensure that each folder \n",
    "containing long file paths is reported only once, along with the maximum path length \n",
    "found for any file within that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV Output Option: Users can choose to generate a CSV file that contains the \n",
    "results. The CSV file includes: order number; length of the longest path - including the file name; and path to the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **USE**\n",
    "To use the script, simply specify the directory path at the designated location \n",
    "and set the `produce_csv` variable to `True` if you wish to generate the CSV output. \n",
    "Run the script to obtain the results in the console and, if applicable, in the CSV file."
